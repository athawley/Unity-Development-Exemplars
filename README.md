# Unity Development Repository with Examples

This repository is used for Unity examples for learnictnow.com and my own professional development.

## Examples
There are Windows based examples that can be downloaded in the releases section.
Source code for the example scene is usually found in the **Assets\_CurrentReleaseExampleCode** folder.

Other examples can be found in the Examples folder.
