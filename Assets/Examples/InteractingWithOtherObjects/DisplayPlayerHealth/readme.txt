Updating the enemy health ui shown to the player

This project uses the ShootProjectilesAndTakeDamage example found in
Examples\InteractingWithOtherObjects\PlayerUI_UpdateEnemyHealthUI folder.

It has a modified prefab of the LocalMultiplayerPlayer which has a modified script on it for editing the enemy health UI that is displayed to the player.
