# Manipulate 3D Objects on a scene

1. Open the scene 'Task_1_1'
1. Add a plane at (0,0,0) (x,y,z)
1. Rescale the plane to x=2, z=4
1. Rename the plane to 'ground'
1. Add a cube to the scene at (1,2,1) with a scale of (0.5,2,3)
1. Add a second cube to thee scene at (0,0,0) that is rotate 45 degrees around the x axis and 15 degrees around the z axis
