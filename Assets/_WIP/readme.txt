This is based on ShootProjectileAndTakeDamage in the Examples\InteractingWithOtherObjects folder

Note the default player object uses an enemy tag.

The goal is to have enemy objects move towards each other if they are within a set radius and then stop moving when a set distance away.

If the object is outside of the set distance the player will not move. Another example will have the enemy object patrolling.
